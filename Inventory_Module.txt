Example:
- Think we are creating a VM Name and using it later for doing load balancing tasks
- So 1st step in a playbook would be creating VM and adding it to a group, so later we can use it in another task for loadbalancing


#add a host
#Supports both Windows/Linux environments
#Use name or host name to represent VM values such host name, ip address and combined
#

- name: "add a host1"
  add_host:
    name: "{{vm_name}}"
	groups:	dev
	port: 80

- name: "add a host2"
  add_host:
    name:		"webvm1:8080"
	groups:		{{grp_name}}

- name: "add a host3"
  add_host:
    hostname:	"{{vm_ip}}:{{vm_port}}"
	groups: 	
	  -dev
      -sys	 
	  
- name: "add a host4"
  add_host:
    hostname:	"10.23.24.2"


#Creating a group based on ansible facts
#if u use a space, it will be converted to -
#Supports both Windows and Linux
#Example would be 

- name: grouping
  group_by:
    key: grp_{{ansible_machine}}
	
- name: grouping
  group_by:
    key: grp_{{ansible_virtualization_type }}_{{ansible_os_family}}

- name: grouping
  group_by:
	key: el{{ansible_virtualization_type}}_{{ansible_os_family}}
	parent:
	  -el{{ansible_virtualization_type}}

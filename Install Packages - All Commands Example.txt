Maven Installation:
The installation of Apache Maven is a simple process of extracting the archive and adding the bin folder with the mvn command to the PATH.

Ensure JAVA_HOME environment variable is set and points to your JDK installation

Download:
apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.zip
OR
apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.tar.gz

Install:
unzip apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.zip
tar xzvf apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.tar.gz

How does Download & Install work when we use package managers like Yum, apt, unarchive etc.?

1st check yum list all to see Maven is available or not. If its present then directly Yum install will work. If not then download need to happen first.

- name: Download package Maven using get url command
  get_url:
    url: http://mirrors.sonic.net/apache/maven/maven-3/3.6.0/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.tar.gz
    dest: /opt/maven/apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.zip
  become: true

- name: Install package Maven using generic package manager
  package:
    name: apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.zip
    state: present

- name: Install package Maven using apt-rpm
  apt_rpm:
    pkg: apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.zip
    state: present
	
- name: Install package Maven using apt
  apt:
    name: apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.zip
    state: present

- name: Install package Maven using yum
  yum:
    name: apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.zip
	state: present

- name: Install package Maven
  unarchive:
    src: http://mirrors.sonic.net/apache/maven/maven-3/3.6.0/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.tar.gz
	dest: /opt/maven/apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.zip
    remote_src: yes

HINT: Does unarchive work here? May be only if we know source server. Also make sure dest folder is setup

Using CURL to install:
- name: Install Maven using CURL operation via shell
  shell:
    name: curl http://mirrors.sonic.net/apache/maven/maven-3/3.6.0/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.tar.gz
